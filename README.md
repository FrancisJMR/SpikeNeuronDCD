Discrete Delay Concidence Detection (DCD) Spiking Neural Network Modelling Framework

This is a small framework for modelling transmission delay discrete (on/off) spiking processes with various network topology options, including random, 2D, and Small World.

These networks can exhibit highly complex dynamics and potentially related to cortical or other coincidence detection dynamics in nervous systems.
